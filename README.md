<h1>Social Links Profile Main</h1>

One of the frontend mentor's beginner challenges. A recreation of a profile with links to social medias.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

* HTML
* CSS

<h2>What was Learned</h2>

* Not much going on here. But I was checking a different way to write CSS. This way does not seem so bad to keep track of, although I am having difficulty with pseudo elements.

<h2>What Needs More Work</h2>

* I was trying to resolve an issue with `flex-direction: column` that resized the image too much. I tried `flex: 0 0 auto`, but no result. It's apparently something
tricky to do, so I decidedto use `rem`, instead of `%`, for the `width` of the img. It stops it from resizing, and it does the job.
